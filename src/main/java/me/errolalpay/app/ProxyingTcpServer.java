/**
 * Proxies inbound TCP requests to an another TCP service.
 * 
 * Principal of operation: This proxy server listens for inbound connections like typical TCP servers do. Once an
 * inbound connection is accepted, the proxy then opens a companion connection, outbound to the outbound service. The 2
 * connections are then indexed together, forwards and backwards, in a HashMap such that the companion connection can be
 * found with predictable performance. Whenever data is read from one connection, the companion connection is retrieved,
 * and that same data is then written to the companion. This "read from connection, write to companion" works in both
 * directions, regardless of which connection (inbound or outbound) sent the data. This read/write back and forth TCP
 * conversation continues until either connection closes itself. At that time, the proxy server assumes the conversation
 * is over, and destroys both connections as well as their membership in the index.
 * 
 * This proxy has an emphasis on privacy, therefore it doesnt log ip addresses, number of bytes written, date/time, etc.
 * It limits logging to only that which helps us see the service is running properly.
 * 
 * The content of the TCP byte streams are not consumed in any way, therefore is it the client connections'
 * responsibility to know the service they are consuming, and to handle all params, auth, SSL, keep-alives etc.
